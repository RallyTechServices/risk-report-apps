#Risk Story Status by Team

For all user stories that are tagged with a particular tag (configured through the app settings), show the break down of the story states where the stories are marked as "High Risk".

A story is marked as "High Risk" if the custom field "Security Business Risk" is set to "High" or there is a string in the Description that matches "Business risk: High".  

A story is bucketed as "Completed/Accepted" if the story is in a state greater than or equal to Completed (this is also a setting).
